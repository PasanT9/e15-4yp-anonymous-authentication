        <h5>Authentication in P2P</h5>

        Absence of a central server makes authentication in peer to peer (P2P)
        networks complex. Traditional cryptographic principles like Public Key
        Infrastructure (PKI) or Identity based Public Key Certificates (ID-PKC)
        are based on a trusted third party. Establishinga trusted third party in
        a semi-trusted network like P2P is a questionable task. Many P2P
        networks propose trust and reputation management schemes to solve this
        problem. Some use trust and reputation schemes to discover peers that
        can be considered as trusted peers of the network. These trusted peers
        are used in authentication as trusted third parties. The idea of
        reputation management systems is to evaluate a peer’s trustworthiness
        based on its interactions with other peers. There exist plenty of
        research in this area; EigenTurst, NICE, Regret, PeerTurst, FuzzyTrust.
        P2P systems that use reputation managements schemes to assist in
        authentication suffer from an obvious flow. These schemes assume that
        the reputation system is intelligentenough not to select malicious users
        as trusted peers. Trusting malicious peers to protect sensitive
        information can harm the system. For example, CST elect a set of peers
        asRPs (Reputed Peers) using EigenTrust. CST creates a pseudo-identity to
        hide the real identity of the user. The link between the identity and
        the pseudo-identity is broken into parts and stored in randomly selected
        RPs to protect users’ privacy. CST trusts RPs to protect the users’
        identity. However, EigenTrust is vulnerable to collaborative attacksand
        therefore there exist a possibility that malicious peers are elected as
        RPs. MaliciousRPs can reveal the identity of a user and exploit their
        privacy.Some researches suggest using a modified PKI for authentication
        in P2P ne
        
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> The concept of Peer to peer (P2P) communication has gained significant 
            attention in the network community over the years. Since the release of 
            Napster in 1998 many P2P applications have been introduced. Bitcoin\cite{Nakamoto}, 
            BitTorrent, TOR\cite{Dingledine}, Freenet\cite{Clarke01freenet:a}, etc are some of 
            the more popular P2P applications. The absence of centralized authority is the main
            reason behind the popularity of P2P applications. This eliminates the need for an 
            expensive central server. Also removes the vulnerability of a single point of failure. 
            P2P networks are considered to be more efficient and scalable than traditional client-server 
            applications.
        </p>

        <p> The decentralized nature of P2P networks makes it difficult to integrate traditional
            authentication mechanisms. Due to this many such networks focus on providing user 
            anonymity rather than authentication. The reduced security of these networks has created
            a lot of possible threats \cite{Wallach}. These threats can vary from uploading malicious 
            files to famous Sybil attacks \cite{Douceur}. Also, the anonymity feature of these networks 
            has created a safe house for cybercriminals \cite{Jardine}. Not being accountable for his/her 
            actions, held responsible and punished for malicious actions, P2P users have the freedom to 
            misbehave. This can cause harm to the network and its users.
        </p> 
        
        <h3> The problem </h3>
        <p> We suggest that even in an anonymous network there should be some level of accountability
            to protect the network and its users. Accountability is achieved through authentication. 
            To integrate an authentication mechanism into an anonymous P2P environment we need to solve 
            two main challenges.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li> Authenticate in a decentralized environment. </li>
            <li> Authenticate without revealing identity. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> These two points have been discussed separately since the start of the internet. Each point 
            has its own difficulties and challenges. Authentication needs to tackle problems like the 
            absence of a central server, certificate management in a distributed environment, the 
            semi-trusted nature of peers, the unpredictable availability of peers, etc.  Authentication 
            need to solve problems like not revealing sensitive information about authenticating party's 
            identity, secure against misbehaving parties (cheating verifiers and cheating provers), 
            unlinkability of authentication sessions, practicality, etc. 
        </p>
        
        <h3> The proposed solution </h3>

        In this paper, we propose three new approaches for anonymous authentication in P2P networks 
        to solve the above problems. 
        
        <ol>
          <li>Ring signature based approach.</li>
          <li>Authenticated key sharing based approach.</li>
          <li>Zero knowledge proof based approach.</li>
        </ol>
        
        We deploy these protocol in a P2P environment where certificates are managed by peers with elevated 
        privileges (super peers). To solve the problems of semi-trusted nature and unpredictable availability 
        of peers we utilize Shamir's secret sharing\cite{Adi} technique. A more detailed explanation of these 
        cryptographic primitives is given in section \rom{3}. Then we test the performance of these ideas in 
        a practical environment developed using the .Net framework.
        
        <h2> Deliverable and milestones </h2>

        <h2> Outline of the report </h2>

        <p>The organization of the paper as follows. In section \rom{2} we present related works in authentication 
           in P2P and anonymous authentication in P2P. Section \rom{3} gives a brief introduction to cryptographic 
           primitives that we used. In section \rom{4} we present the implementation design of the P2P environment 
           including certificate management. Section \rom{5} introduce the proposed authentication protocols including 
           security proofs for the two latter protocols. We review the experimental results and do a performance analysis 
           in section \rom{6}. Section \rom{7} conclude our research.

        <h3> Authentication in P2P </h3>
        
        <p> Absence of a central server makes authentication in peer to peer (P2P) networks complex. Traditional 
            cryptographic principles like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or Identity based Public Key Certificates 
            (ID-PKC) are based on a trusted third party. Establishing a trusted third party in a semi-trusted network 
            like P2P is a questionable task. Many P2P networks propose trust and reputation management schemes to solve 
            this problem.\cite{Gokhale} ,\cite{Xiaoliang},  \cite{Tsangs} use trust and reputation schemes to discover 
            peers that can be considered as trusted peers of the network. These trusted peers are used in authentication 
            as trusted third parties.
        </p>
        <p> The idea of reputation management systems is to evaluate a peer’s trustworthiness based on its interactions 
            with other peers. There exist plenty of research in this area; EigenTurst \cite{Kamvar}, NICE\cite{Lee}, 
            Regret \cite{Sabater-Mir},  PeerTurst\cite{Xiong}, FuzzyTrust \cite{Song}.
        </p>
        <p> P2P systems that use reputation managements schemes to assist in authentication suffer from an obvious flow. 
            These schemes assume that the reputation system is intelligent enough not to select malicious users as 
            trusted peers. Trusting malicious peers to protect sensitive information can harm the system. For example, 
            CST \cite{Wang} elect a set of peers as RPs (Reputed Peers) using EigenTrust. CST creates a pseudo-identity 
            to hide the real identity of the user. The link between the identity and the pseudo-identity is broken into 
            parts and stored in randomly selected RPs to protect users’ privacy. CST trusts RPs to protect the users’ 
            identity. However, EigenTrust is vulnerable to collaborative attacks and therefore there exist a possibility 
            that malicious peers are elected as RPs. Malicious RPs can reveal the identity of a user and exploit their privacy.
        </p>
        <p> Some researches suggest using a modified PKI for authentication in P2P networks \cite{Oh}, \cite{Josephson}. 
            Rather than having a single centralized authority, the responsibility of the Certificate Authority (CA) is 
            distributed across multiple peers in the network. This improves the scalability and robustness of the authentication 
            process.
        </p>  
        <p> The downside of using PKI in P2P is certificate management becomes complex. The authentication process becomes 
            difficult to implement effectively. \cite{Josephson} use a set of peers as Authentication Servers (ASs). Even 
            though this improves the scalability of the network, introduce new security risks like unreliability in certificate 
            access and verification.
        </p>  
        <p> To solve the problem of the absence of a centralized authority and at the same time keep the authentication process 
            reliable, modern authentication schemes utilize blockchain technology. There is a lot of literature that proposes 
            the idea of using blockchain technology to create a Distributed PKI \cite{Papageorgiou}, \cite{Karaarslan}, \cite{Yakubov}, 
            \cite{Orman}. This seems to be a good solution to overcome the limitations of having a central trusted certificate authority. 
            Blockchain can make the process of a CA distributed, immutable and transparent. Therefore can successfully solve the problems 
            of malicious CAs, MITM attacks and single point of failure. Blockchain is used as a distributed key-value data storage. 
            The data is public and readable to everyone.\cite{Sivakumar2017}  propose the idea of using smart contracts to certificate management. 
        </p>
        <p> The DPKI is only secure as long as honest nodes control collectively more than 51\% of computing power. Also some argues the need 
            of blockchain to decentralized PKI since the technology of blockchain is still new to the industry.
        </p>
        <p> The PGP Web of Trust \cite{Bob2005ThePT} is another way to navigate the problem of not having a trusted central authority. 
            WoT distribute the responsibility of a CA among users. The core concept of WoT is trust chains. For a simpler explanation, 
            assume A wants to authenticate himself to B. There is a user C who trusts B. C can sign A’s certificate after verifying its 
            authenticity. Then A can send the signed certificate to B. Since C has signed A’s certificate and B trusts C. B can trust A’s 
            certificate is authentic. Using indirect trust chains WoT creates a community of trusted users. However WoT is not suitable 
            P2P networks since, it is difficult for a new peer to join the network without personally knowing a existing user of the network.
        </p>
        
        <h3> Anonymous Authentication in P2P </h3>

        <p> The concept of anonymous authentication has been around for sometime. Pseudo Trust\cite{LuLi} has been one of the more popular 
            publications of this topic. Pseudo Trust (PT) utilize the concept of double pseudonyms combine with zero knowledge proofs to 
            authenticate users anonymously. PT also uses onion routing\cite{Dingledine} and EigenTrust\cite{Kamvar} trust management to provide 
            a complete file delivery system with anonymous authentication. The anonymity comes from the one way property of the cryptographic 
            hash functions. PT neglect one important feature of using the concept of pseudonyms to obtain anonymity. PT does not change PI 
            (pseudo identity) prior to each authentication process. The PT protocol requires PIC (certificate of pseudo identity) to be send 
            to the other party to start the authentication. Since PIC is same for a user, an eavesdropper can link two communication sessions 
            to a specific user.
        </p>
        <p> \cite{Han2020} proposes an similar authentication scheme to PT for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The only difference is the slight 
            change of the zero knowledge proof and absence of onion routing the trust management. This also suffers from the same vulnerabilities 
            as PT.
        </p>  
        <p> \cite{Tsangs} present an interesting approach to anonymous authentication. PPAA uses tags to obtain anonymity and at the same time 
            link communication sessions. The idea is to use IDs of the two parties involved in the communication session create a tag. The two 
            parties will not learn any knowledge other than the tag from running the protocol. To avoid having the same tag for different 
            communication sessions between the same parties PPAA propose to include an event id into the tag design. Therefore only a party 
            involved in the communication will be able to link a communication session to a previous session with the same party. The PPAA is 
            secure in random oracle model if eXternal Diffie-Hellmam (XDH) and q-SDH assumption holds.
        </p>  
        <p> CST\cite{Xiaoliang} uses collaboration signature to authenticate users anonymously. As mentioned in section 2.1 CST uses EigenTrust\cite{Kamvar} 
            reputation system to select trusted peers (RPs). This is not safe in a semi-trusted environment like P2P networks. Other than that CST is said to 
            be resilient against impersonate attacks, traceability and collaboration attacks.
        </p>  
        <p> \cite{Sun} presents a similar method as CST. They use FBST\cite{Piveteau}[Fair Blind Signatures] to present novel authentication scheme that 
            keep the anonymity of honest users. Similar to CST this uses a trust management system called SOBIE to elect peers as super peers (SPs) and 
            reputed peers (RPs). They are assumed to be trust worthy and play and important role in authentication. However, as mentioned previously trust 
            management systems are not perfect. Malicious peers can get elected as SPs and RPs and they are able to revoke users' anonymity. Similar to CST, 
            \cite{Sun} uses the concept of Shamir's secret sharing \cite{Adi} to reduce the vulnerability of exposed RPs. \cite{Adi}[How to share a secret] 
            present a way to break a key and store it in multiple places and recreate the key when required. \cite{Sun} use this technique to break the key 
            (link between ID and pseudo ID) and store it among multiple RPs. Therefore even if few RPs got compromise it does not reveal user's identity. 
            Also a user use anonymous multicast to communicate with a SP. This makes it impossible for a SP to reveal an identity of a user.
        </p>
        <p> \cite{Wierzbicki2005} uses an combination of Merkle's puzzles\cite{Pasini} and zero knowledge proofs to provide anonymous authentication.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3> Cryptographic Primitives </h3>

        <h4> Zero Knowledge Proof </h4>

        <p> Zero knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a protocol that allows a prover to prove the possession of some secret to a verifier without revealing the secret 
            or any information related to the secret. The first idea of ZKP was introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in 
            \cite{inbook}. Since then many different ZKPs have been published \cite{Tang}, \cite{Feige}, \cite{Cramer}, \cite{Sahai}. ZKPs are widely used 
            in cryptography to implement cryptographic protocols due to its privacy, authentication and low complexity.</p>

        <p> A zero knowledge proof consists of a prover and verifier. In a zero knowledge protocol, a prover must prove the knowledge of some secret using 
            an interactive challenge-response scheme. The protocol must not reveal any information regarding the secret other than the knowledge of prover 
            has the secret. A secure zkp must satisfy soundness, completeness and zero knowledge properties.</p>  

        <p> There are two types of zero knowledge systems; interactive zero knowledge proofs and non-interactive zero knowledge proofs \cite{Wu}. Our 
            proposed protocol uses a zkp that utilize quadratic residues in modular arithmetic.</p>

        <h4> Ring Signatures </h4>

        <p> The notion of ring signature was first introduced in 2001 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Yael Tauman Kalai in \cite{Rivest}. Ring signatures 
            are used to digitally sign messages on behalf of a group. At the same time, makes it computationally difficult to find the exact signer.</p> 

        <p> Ring signatures are designed to provide anonymity to the message signer. The same functionality is provided by group signatures \cite{Davies1991}. 
            The only difference in group signature is that it needs an authoritative entity to generate the signature. Therefore that entity can revoke the 
            anonymity of the signer. Ring signatures do not depend on a third party to generate a signature. Ring signatures are spontaneous and provide 
            unconditional anonymity.</p>

        <p> Over the years different ring signature schemes have been published with different features; threshold ring signatures \cite{Bresson}, 
            linkable ring signatures\cite{Liu}, revocable ring signatures\cite{Dennis}, traceable ring signatures\cite{Fujisaki}.</p> 

        <p> Consider a scenario where a group of k entities where each entity has a public key Pi and a corresponding secret key Si. An entity r 
            can generate a ring signature on a message m using $(m, P_1, …, P_k, S_r)$. Anyone with the knowledge of $m, P_1, …, P_k$ can verify the ring 
            signature. No one outside the group (without a secret key $S_i$) can generate a valid ring signature for the same group.</p>

        <h4> Shamir's Secret Sharing </h4>

        <p> In 1979 Adi Shamir introduced the concept of Shamir's secret sharing\cite{Adi}[How to Share a Secret]. This allows a secret to be divided 
            into n parts. The secret can be reconstructed with atleast t parts where $(1 \leq t \leq n)$. No knowledge about the secret can be learnt 
            with (t-1) parts.</p>

        <p> The concept is based on polynomial interpolation. The idea is to generate a polynomial f(x) of (t-1) points. First we select (t-1) random 
            positive integers such that $(a_1, a_2, .., a_{t-1})$. Then set $a_0$ to the secret we want to share. These points are used to generate 
            the polynomial f(x). </p>

         <p> f(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + ... + a<sub>(t-1)</sub>x<sup>(t-1)</sup>

         <p> Then we get n points $(x_i, y_i)$ corresponding to the polynomial. Given any subset of t points $a_0$ can be found by lagrange basis 
             interpolation.</p> 

        
         \[ l_i = \frac{x - x_0}{x_i-x_0} \times \frac{x - x_1}{x_i-x_1} \times ... \times \frac{x - x_{t-1}}{x_i-x_{t-1}}\]

         \[ f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} y_il_i(x)) \]
        

        <p> The idea of Shamir's secret sharing is a popular concept in p2p systems. A p2p network does not have an centralized database to store 
            peers' keys. Storing keys in a selected set of peers might not be a good idea since p2p is a semi-trusted environment. For an example 
            when a peer request a key from another peer, he might not respond. Therefore keys need to be broken into parts and distributed among 
            multiple peers. A peer  should be able to reconstruct a key without the knowledge of all the parts. \cite{Xiaoliang}, \cite{Sun} 
            are p2p anonymous authentication mechanisms that use the concept of Shamir's secret sharing.</p>

 

        <h3>Conceptual design </h3>

\subsection{P2P network design}

Using the .Net framework we implemented a hybrid P2P network\cite{BeverlyYang2003}. A traditional hybrid peer to peer network consists of peers and super peers. Hybrid P2P systems is a combination of purely distributed P2P systems and mediated P2P  systems. Hybrid systems are designed to overcome the problems of the two mentioned systems. These systems provide search efficiency of mediated P2P systems while maintaining the reliability of decentralization similar to pure P2P systems\cite{Backx2002}. 

Our P2P network consists of three types of entities; the main server, ordinary peers (hereafter mentioned as peers) and super peers. A peer communicates with the main server only at the time of registration. Users join the network as peers. Peers are ordinary service requestors. They are connected to the system through super peers. Every peer is assumed to be behind a NAT environment. Peers with public IP addresses and higher computational power are promoted to be super peers. 

Super peers have more responsibility for the system. A super peer is connected to one or more other super peers in the network and responsible for one or more peers. They can communicate among other super peers using the super network. Super peers can join or leave the network at any time. Dynamic behaviour of super peers should not affect the connectivity of the network. Our design of the network is able to change the topology according to this dynamic behaviour of peers and maintain connectivity among existing super peers.

A super peer is only responsible for nodes under his scope and does not know any information regarding other peers of the system.
Therefore a node discovery process becomes an exhaustive task. This can be accomplished in two ways; flooding search and random walk. We utilize flooding search in this project since the random walk is not guaranteed to produce results\cite{Ahmed2011}.

\subsection{Distributed Certificate Management}

The decentralized environment of the P2P network does not allow traditional methods of authentication. It's difficult to maintain a centralized database of certificates where the availability of peers cannot be predicted. Distributing certificates among super peers is not a viable solution since super peers are not always available. Therefore all the certificates under this super peer remains not accessible. Also, malicious super peers might delete certificates from the network. The obvious solution is to keep multiple copies of the certificates. We propose a different solution by using Shamir's secret sharing algorithm. The idea is to break the certificates into multiple parts and distribute across the P2P network. When needed, the certificates can be reconstructed from a minimal subset of the parts. A more detailed explanation of the implementation is given in section 3.3.1 .

\subsection{Proposed Authentication Schemes}

 \subsubsection{Ring Signature Based approach}
 
The characteristics of ring signatures make it an interesting primitive in obtaining anonymous authentication. Ring signatures allows a message to be signed by a group of public keys. Making it impossible to identify the exact signer. The original ring signature scheme\cite{Rivest} and most of the proposed ring signatures provide complete anonymity. This is not suitable for authentication. This make it impossible to revoke the anonymity of malicious peers. Therefore we used the revocable ring signature scheme proposed in \cite{Dennis} to create a simple authentication protocol that protect users' privacy. This is just a simple suggestion, of a way to obtain anonymous authentication using existing ring signature schemes. The idea is to challenge prover to generate a ring signature using a random nonce generated by a verifier. If the prover is able to accomplish this he can successfully authenticate himself. 

 \subsubsection{Authenticated key sharing based approach}
 
 We propose a novel authentication mechanism that allows a peer to authenticate without revealing their identity. The basic idea of the protocol is to present prover a set of public keys and challenge to prove the knowledge of atleast one secret key corresponding to a public key from the set. This idea is simple but the protocol should not reveal any information related to the prover's identity. Also a prover without a valid key pair should not be able to authenticate himself. To accomplish that we employ a authenticated key sharing scheme introduced in \cite{Alawatugoda}.


\subsubsection{Zero Knowledge Proof Based Approach}

 Zkp is a popular approach to obtain anonymous authentication in p2p networks. This technique has been utilized in \cite{LuLi}, \cite{Han2020} and \cite{Tsangs}. Many of these approaches relies on pseudonyms to hide the identity. We propose a new authentication protocol that uses zero knowledge proofs to hide the identity among a group of users. The protocol achieves properties similar to ring signatures. This is an modification of the Schnorr's zero knowledge proof \cite{Soares2013}. The method is similar to the authenticated key sharing based approach in the sense that the challenge is to prove the knowledge of a secret key in a set of public keys. However unlike previous method, we use zero knowledge proofs to do that. Therefore this method achieve k anonymity. 


\section{Methodological approach}


\subsection{Distributed Certificate Management}

During the initial interaction of a peer, the corresponding super peer obtains the peer's certificate. The super peer breaks the certificate into n parts using Shamir's algorithm. The super peer then floods these parts across the network. Once a request to recreate the certificate(s) received. Super peer again floods a request(s) to collect the parts of the certificate. The super peers that are holding these parts will send them to the corresponding super peers. The original certificate can be recreated as long as r parts are received by the super peer (r $\leq$ n).

This technique allows distributing certificates in a more dynamic way. As long as r super peers can be accessed, the certificate can be recreated. This method only requires minimal storage. That is, the size of a single part does not exceed the size of the certificate. This is also the more flexible approach. n and r can be changed for each certificate without affecting other certificates. However, then there needs to be a way to identify n and r for each certificate. 

n and r are performance metrics. Increasing n will increase the average key storage size in super peers. In section \rom{6} we analyze the performance of increasing r while n is kept as a constant.

\subsection{Proposed Authentication Schemes}

 \subsubsection{Ring Signature Based approach}
 
 The protocol starts by the prover collecting a set of certificates from the super peer. Prover then randomly select a subset of the certificates. Then he verify the authenticity of the certificates and obtains the set of public keys from the subset of certificates using main server's public key. Prover hides his own certificate among this subset of certificates and send them to the verifier to initiate the authentication. After authenticating the certificates, verifier obtains the set of public keys using main server's public key. Then verifier generates a random nonce and challenge prover to generate a ring signature for this random nonce, using the above set of public keys. Prover use his secret key, the set of public keys and main server's public key to generate a ring signature according to the algorithm proposed in \cite{Dennis}. Prover then sends the ring signature to the verifier. Verifier verifies the authenticity of the ring signature according to the random nonce he sent at the previous step. If the verification is successful, authentication is complete. Otherwise verifier sends a fail message.


 \subsubsection{Authenticated key sharing based approach}
 
 As same as the previous approach prover collects a set of certificates from the super peer. Then randomly select a subset out of them. After verifying the authenticity of the certificates prover extract the corresponding public keys. Prover mix his certificate into the subset of certificates and send them to the verifier. Verifier obtains the public keys after verifying the authenticity of the certificates. Then generate $X = g^x$ by selecting a random x. Then use the set of public keys to encrypt X. Thus creating a set of ciphertexts where each corresponds to a different public key from the set. Since one of the public key is prover's, he will be able decrypt X with his secret key. After decrypting X, prover selects a random y and calculates $Y = g^y$. Then generate $K = X^y$. K is the shared key. Then he sends Y to the verifier encrypted with verifier's public key. Verifier decrypts Y. Then compute $K = Y^x$. At this stage both parties have the same shared key K. Verifier encrypts a random number R using a symmetric key encryption scheme using K as the key. Then challenge prover to decrypt this and send R back. If the prover generated the correct K at the previous steps, he will be able to decrypt R. Therefore prover can successfully authenticate himself. Otherwise verifier sends a fail message. 

\subsubsection{Zero Knowledge Proof Based Approach}

As same as the above two methods prover collects k certificates from the super peer. Then randomly select n-1 certificates and create $C$ and $P$ vectors as the above methods. However in this method public key is $A_u = g^{a_u} mod p$ where $a_u$ is the private key. Similar to Schnorr's protocol prover generates U. The difference is U contains factors of $A_i^{v_i}$ where $v_i$ is a random number. This is generated only using the collected public keys (Prover's public key is not in U). Prover then send U to the verifier. Verifier sends a challenge c to the prover. Prover xor all elements of $v_i$ with c to obtain $v_p$. Then mix $v_p$ among the set of $v_i$ s and send them along with the set of public keys (including prover's public key) to the verifier. Prover also sends r which is $s - a_pv_p mod p$. Then prover does two steps of verification. First he xor $v_i$ s and check if it's equal to c. If it is not terminate the authentication. Otherwise generate $U^{\prime}$ using r, A and $v_i$ s. If $U = U^{\prime}$ authentication is successful. Otherwise sends a fail message to the prover. A more detailed explanation is given in section 4.1.3 .
